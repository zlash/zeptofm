# ZeptoFM  

Guts of a node based synth inteded for tiny games and demos.

* Instruments and patterns created with code. Easier for procedural stuff and shouldn't affect final size too much in comparison with a data based approach when using a minifier.
* Pre rendered instruments, realtime patterns
* Intended for use with a minifier. Not golfed or anything.
* Practically no error checking

This software has never been used and is considered pre-alpha.
